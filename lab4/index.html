	<h1>Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
		<p>In this lab, we take a look into pseudocoding and problem solving for when we look into writing for Javascript!</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The challenges from this lab was figuring out what instructions to make for the pseudocoding. Another challenge was how to use the pre and code tags, since we never used them before.
			I don't know If I used them right, but we'll find out!</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The results of the lab was how we learned with pseudocoding!</p>
	<pre><code>
		// Create a 8x8 board
		  // Black and red squares
		    // Every other square is red
		      // Define player pieces
		        // Take user input
		          // Authenticate user input
		            //Take AI/Player input
		              // Validate
		                // check win condition
		        // If no win, reset to step 5
	</code></pre>
