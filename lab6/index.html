				<h1>Arrays and Objects</h1>
					<p>In this lab, we Look into how Arrays and Objects are used.</p>
				<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>Challenges were once again writing the new code that we had learned. I got a bit stumped and got confused of using "=" instead of ":" when writing the object.
						The array I had no problems with though.</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem I had with the lab was getting the age to display. However, looking at the screenshots in Task 2, it wasn't printed out either.
						Was there something we were going to learn in the future with "function()?"</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here are the results of the Lab!</p>
