				<h1>Data Types and Variables</h1>
					<p>In this lab, we finally start diving into Javascript by looking into how we set variables to types.</p>
				<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>Challenges were writing the new code that we had learned. Furthermore, I had to keep relying on Task 1, as well as lab instructions to ensure what I was doing was correct in the code.</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem I had with the lab was distinguishing if it was a I or L in the code "writeln". It at first seemed like "write in." However, it was the not the case, as it was a lower case l.</p>
				<h2>Questions I have.</h2>
					<p> Why is it in our Javascript code for age, is it " ' year'br'"? Why is that "br" needed?</p>
					<p>We might get into this later in the semester, but I'm curious how making a timer would work? Possibly even how to write a self-calculating script of some sort?</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here are the results of the Lab! Check out my car that I totally own and didn't make up!</p>
