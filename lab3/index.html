	<h1>File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
		<p>In this lab, we look at how we publish our local files to a server, as well as how the directory should look like within our respective file systems.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>A couple challenges I faced was making sure that some of the tags had communicated how I wanted to, and getting used to the new shortcut feature.
			For example, if I wanted to list (li) withing a link (a), I might have to manually type one of the tags out.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here are the results of this Lab!</p>
