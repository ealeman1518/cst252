    <h2>Anon functions and Callbacks</h2>
      <p>In this lab, we take a look at anonymous functions and callbacks!</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>The challenge for the lab is to write the anonymous function and getting it to call back to the console.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>I perrsonally didn't have many problems with the lab, as it was pretty straight forward and exactly done as shown in the lecture last class, just various orders to call back.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Peep the console for the output!!</p>
